# Random Fortune Generator

## Description
This simple program generates a random fortune. This program was made as part of the Codecademy portfolio project. The scope of the project was to use JavaScript to create a program that will randomly generate a sentence. 
    
While not every word is random, there are four words in the fortune that are randomly selected from four different arrays to produce the outcome. 

This was decided instead of a completly random sentence to ensure that the sentence produced made sense.

## Features
Produces a random fortune.

## How to use
Simply run the program and check the console for the output.

Re-run the program to produce a different fortune.

### Example output:
    To avoid the burden of defeat, run with happiness to be overcome with creativity.
The words "**defeat**", "**run**", "**happiness**", and "**creativity**" are the randomly selected words in the above example.


## Technologies
The program is written entirely in JavaScript
